This is the Second project I created in during my internship.
I tried to do something different this time so for the frontend I went with Blazor, Though there is not much resource out there but I started learning it through 
some youtube video and took help from the documentation.
Backend is .NET 6 Web APi 
Created WASM and now We are here

Opinion on Blazor ->
  For any c#,.NET developer who doesnt want to learn Javascript to learn a SPA like angular,react ;This is Everthing.
